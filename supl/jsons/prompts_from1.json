Begin with the overall body shape and size of an ostrich, emphasizing its tall, slender form. Replace the ostrich's long neck with that of a horse, maintaining the elegance and poise associated with horses but scaled to fit the ostrich's larger frame. Incorporate the horse's front legs into this design, blending them seamlessly into the lower body to create a harmonious contrast between grace (from the horse) and speed (inherent in an ostrich). Use earthy tones such as muted browns and tans to blend both animals' natural colors, ensuring visual cohesion. The resulting image should present one cohesive creature that embodies elements from both species in minimalist simplicity.\""

Start with the body of a horse, characterized by its sleek and muscular form. Replace the horse's ears with the distinctive longer ears of a donkey, and incorporate the donkey's slightly stockier legs to suggest strength and functionality. Use a neutral color palette, blending the typical brown and gray hues found in both animals to maintain harmony in the design.

        "output": "\" \\nCreate a minimalistic image of a hybrid animal combining features of a horse and a greyhound. Begin with the body of a horse, focusing on its powerful hindquarters and strong back. Replace the horse's front legs with the slender, athletic front legs of a greyhound, emphasizing speed and agility. Incorporate the greyhound's narrow, aerodynamic head into the design, blending it seamlessly with the horse's neck to create an illusion of fluid motion. Utilize a muted color scheme featuring shades of gray to reflect both animals' potential coat colors, ensuring visual cohesion in this dynamic mashup creature that embodies both strength and swiftness. Maintain simplicity in design elements to highlight the fusion of these two distinct animals into one cohesive form.\""
