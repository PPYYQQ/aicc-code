Replace the traditional windmill blades with large, petal-like extensions resembling those of a flower, ensuring they are angled to capture the breeze much like the original blades but also evoke the delicate appearance of floral petals. Use soft pastel colors for the petals and maintain earthy tones for the stem to highlight contrast while preserving visual harmony in this unique fusion. Ensure the overall image is simple and clean, focusing on blending functionality with organic beauty to present a singular, cohesive object.'"

Start with the slender stem of the flower, extending it to resemble the vertical axis of a weathervane. Replace the flower's petals with geometric shapes inspired by traditional weathervanes, such as triangular or rectangular forms, arranged in a symmetrical pattern around the stem's tip to evoke movement and directionality. Use metallic hues for these shapes to give them an airy, weathered look that contrasts subtly with the natural green tone of the stem. Ensure simplicity in design by minimizing details and emphasizing clean lines throughout, presenting one cohesive object that blends organic and industrial elements harmoniously.\""
