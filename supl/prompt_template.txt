    Create a minimalistic image of a hybrid animal combining features of a horse and a donkey. Start with the body of a horse, characterized by its sleek and muscular form. Replace the horse's ears with the distinctive longer ears of a donkey, and incorporate the donkey's slightly stockier legs to suggest strength and functionality. Use a neutral color palette, blending the typical brown and gray hues found in both animals to maintain harmony in the design. Ensure the overall image is simple and clean, focusing on the seamless integration of features to present a single, unified creature.
