Create an image in a minimalistic style focusing on the theme of "Pollution." The composition includes a turtle, a straw, and a noose. Imagine a simple, clean background. The turtle should be central, representing innocence and nature. The straw, symbolizing pollution, can be depicted as hovering above the turtle, its shadow casting a foreboding presence. The noose, illustrating the threat, should gracefully loop around the straw, implying danger without being overtly aggressive. Keep lines and colors minimal, using a muted palette to emphasize the somber message without cluttering the visual space.
