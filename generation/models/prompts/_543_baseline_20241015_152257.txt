Create a minimalistic image centered on the theme of environmental degradation. Position a large globe in the center as the focal point. Overlay a transparent trash bag partially covering the globe, symbolizing the overwhelming impact of waste and pollution on our planet. Use a subdued color palette with earth tones and subtle shades of black and gray to emphasize the seriousness of the topic. Ensure the composition is clean and simple, drawing attention to the juxtaposition of the globe and the trash bag.
