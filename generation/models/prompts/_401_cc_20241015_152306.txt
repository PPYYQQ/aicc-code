Create a minimalistic image that captures the impact of pollution by transforming the image of an anatomical heart into a trash bag. Focus on the visual similarities between the two objects, such as their rounded contours and complex shapes. Replace the heart's form entirely with the texture and appearance of a trash bag, maintaining its anatomical features through the bag's folds and ties. Use a monochromatic color scheme to emphasize the message, ensuring the viewer sees only one object: a trash bag shaped unmistakably like a heart. This image should evoke a sense of pollution's encroachment on human vitality and health.
