Create an image of a single, minimalistic object that combines elements of a toothpaste tube, a fish, and cod roe. Visualize a toothpaste tube as the main body, but the cap and nozzle area are replaced with a fish head, seamlessly blending the two. The body of the tube features the texture and color pattern of a fish's scales, transitioning toward the tail end. Instead of the tail, the end of the tube opens to reveal cod roe spilling out, mimicking the appearance of squeezed toothpaste. The colors should be soft, focusing on the whites and blues of toothpaste, the silvers and greys of a fish, and the vibrant orange of the roe. The background is to remain plain and neutral, emphasizing the singular object.
