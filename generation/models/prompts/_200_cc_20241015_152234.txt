Create an image of a minimalistic style depicting a theme of Work-Life Imbalance by illustrating a hand reaching out towards an American flag. The hand should be positioned as if it is grasping or holding onto the flag, capturing a sense of entrapment or confinement, but with the flag entirely replacing any imagery of prison bars. The image should convey the idea of being trapped by national or societal pressures, symbolized by the American flag, while maintaining a simple and uncluttered aesthetic.
