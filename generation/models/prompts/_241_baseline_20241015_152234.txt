Create an image in a minimalistic style with the theme of "Simplicity." The scene features a single Lay's Classic potato chip bag positioned centrally on a clean, neutral background. Next to it, illustrate a few delicate potato seedlings, their slender green stems and small leaves offering a subtle contrast to the bag. Use soft, muted colors and avoid any extraneous details to maintain the simplicity of the composition. The overall mood should convey a sense of balance and understated elegance.
