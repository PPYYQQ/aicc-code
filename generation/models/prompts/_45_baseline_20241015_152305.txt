Create an image in a minimalistic style on the topic of "Knowledge Transfer." The image should feature a simple yet striking composition: a stylized brain connected to a book with a socket. The brain should be depicted as a smooth and clean outline or silhouette, symbolizing the source of knowledge. The book, positioned nearby, should have a clear and distinct socket, implying a connection or transfer of knowledge. Use a limited color palette, focusing on soft neutral tones or simple monochrome, to emphasize the concept without unnecessary detail. The background should be plain to keep the focus on the central theme.
