Create an image featuring a minimalistic style on the theme of "Work-Life Imbalance". The composition should include the following elements: An American flag subtly faded in the background, representing a backdrop of societal expectations. Two hands reaching out from behind prison bars, symbolizing the feeling of being trapped. Ensure the overall color palette remains muted to emphasize the sense of entrapment and imbalance.
