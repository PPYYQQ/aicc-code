Create an image in a minimalistic style focused on the theme of "Symmetry in Nature." Use the visual similarity between the branching structure of lungs and the segmented interior of an orange. Replace the entire lung structure with a single orange, emphasizing how the segments radiate from a central core like the bronchi and bronchioles of lungs. Ensure the image remains uncluttered, with a simple color palette, highlighting the orange's natural hues against a plain background to draw attention to the symmetry and organic patterns shared by both objects.
