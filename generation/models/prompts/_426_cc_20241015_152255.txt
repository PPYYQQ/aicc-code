Create an image of a minimalistic and thought-provoking mashup object on the theme of health risks. Combine a knife and an ice lolly into one singular object. Focus on the visual similarities, such as the elongated shape and slender form. Imagine the ice lolly with its typical wooden stick handle, but replace the stick with the blade of the knife, keeping the knife's handle visible at the base. The ice lolly part should retain its colorful, glossy appearance, contrasting with the metallic sheen of the knife blade. Ensure this single fused object stands alone against a plain background to emphasize its form and conceptual message about health risks.
