The pencil point leads into the missile's sleek body, symbolizing the transformation of ideas into impactful action. Use a clean background with a limited color palette, focusing on the contrast between the simplicity of the pencil and the complexity of the missile. Highlight the synergy between creativity and power, suggesting the profound influence writing can have.
