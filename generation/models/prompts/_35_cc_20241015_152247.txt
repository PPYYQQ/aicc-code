Create a minimalistic image featuring a turtle intertwined with a single straw in place of a noose, emphasizing the impact of pollution. The image should capture the turtle as if it is swimming through the water while the straw loosely encircles its neck, symbolizing the threat of plastic waste. Ensure the scene is simple, using stark contrasts or a limited color palette to reflect the minimalistic style.
