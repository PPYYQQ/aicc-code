Create a minimalistic illustration featuring the theme of pollution. Include the following elements: a single, discarded straw partially submerged in a clear blue cup of ice water, symbolizing its contribution to pollution. Beside the cup, depict a simple silhouette of a fish, swimming near the straw, highlighting the impact of pollution on marine life. Use a clean, minimalist color palette with muted blues and grays to convey a sense of urgency and simplicity.
