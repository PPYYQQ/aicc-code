Create a minimalistic image that depicts the concept of election manipulation using the following elements: a stack of simple, uniformly designed ballots or votes, and a paper shredder. Position the stack of votes as if they are being fed directly into the paper shredder. Ensure the paper shredder is clearly identifiable and actively shredding the votes, symbolizing the destruction or tampering of the voting process. The background should be plain to emphasize the focus on the votes being shredded, conveying a sense of loss or corruption in the election process.
