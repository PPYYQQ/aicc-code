Create an image of a minimalistic mashup that combines a missile and a pencil into a single object. Visualize a pencil that seamlessly transitions into the shape of a missile. The bottom half should resemble the wooden body of a traditional yellow pencil, complete with the sharpened graphite tip. As the pencil extends upwards, it gradually transforms into the sleek, metallic form of a missile, maintaining the cylindrical shape but adding elements like fins and a streamlined nose cone. The colors transition naturally from the familiar yellow and gray of the pencil to the metallic gray or silver of a missile, creating a smooth, unified design. The background should be a simple, solid color to emphasize the hybrid object, highlighting the concept of the "Power of Writing."
