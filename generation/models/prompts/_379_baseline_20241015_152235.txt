Create an image in a minimalistic style centered around the theme of "Influence." The composition should feature a pistol and a loudspeaker. Position the pistol on one side, angled slightly downward, symbolizing force or aggression. On the opposite side, place the loudspeaker, angled upwards, representing communication or persuasion. Use a simple color palette with a focus on contrast, perhaps utilizing black, white, and a single accent color to emphasize the theme. Focus on clean lines and a balanced composition to highlight the juxtaposition of these two objects symbolizing different forms of influence.
