Create an image in a minimalistic style that conveys the theme of "Destruction" using the following elements: A cross tombstone, an air-dropped bomb, and a fighter jet. Arrange the composition with a simplistic and clean design, focusing on strong silhouettes and contrasting shapes to highlight the concept of destruction. Use a limited color palette, perhaps black, white, and gray, to emphasize the starkness and emotional impact of the scene. The cross tombstone should be in the foreground, symbolizing loss, with the air-dropped bomb and fighter jet in the background, representing the instruments of destruction.
