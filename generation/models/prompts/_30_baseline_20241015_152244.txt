Create a minimalistic illustration focusing on the theme of climate change. In the image, place a solitary penguin standing on a melting ice lolly. The ice lolly should be partially melted, with droplets pooling at its base to emphasize the melting effect. Use a simple color palette with cool tones, such as blues and whites, to reflect the cold environment. Keep the background plain to maintain the minimalist feel, drawing attention to the penguin and the melting ice lolly as the central elements.
