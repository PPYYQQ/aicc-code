Create a minimalist image that conveys the theme of "Consequences." The composition includes a silhouette of a man standing, with a large chat bubble above his head, symbolizing communication or thoughts. Attached to his ankle is a ball and chain, signifying burden or restraint. Use a simple, limited color palette to enhance the minimalist style and emphasize the concept of being weighed down by words or decisions.
