Create a minimalistic image illustrating the theme of pollution. In the image, depict a serene sea as the background. In the foreground, place a plastic bag subtly mimicking the shape of a jellyfish, allowing it to gently float as if it were part of the marine environment. Use a simple color palette with shades of blue for the sea and translucent whites or grays for the plastic bag to emphasize the delicate yet impactful nature of ocean pollution.
