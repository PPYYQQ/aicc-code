Create a minimalistic style image depicting the theme of safety by combining a skeletal X-ray and a safety belt. The image should feature a simple, clean design with a monochromatic color palette. The skeletal X-ray should be centrally placed as a translucent overlay, showing the outline of a human torso. Overlay this with a bold, graphic representation of a safety belt crossing diagonally over the torso, emphasizing the concept of protection and security. The background should be plain to keep the focus on the interplay between the X-ray and the safety belt.
