Create a minimalistic image depicting a fighter jet soaring through the sky. Below, instead of an air-dropped bomb, there is a cross tombstone falling toward the earth. The scene should convey the transformation from destruction to the aftermath, focusing solely on the sleek silhouette of the fighter jet and the stark, solitary form of the cross tombstone against a simple background.
