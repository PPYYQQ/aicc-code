Create a minimalistic image featuring a single object that conveys the theme of urgency. The object is a mashup of a timer and the Earth. The shape of the object is primarily spherical, similar to the Earth, but with distinctive features of a timer. Replace the hour markers on the Earth's surface with the numbers and tick marks typically found on a timer, creating a sense of urgency. The color scheme should be simple, using predominantly blues and greens for the 'Earth' portion, and incorporating metallic or white tones for the 'timer' elements, ensuring the object remains cohesive and singular in focus.
