Create a minimalistic mashup image that combines a skeletal x-ray and a safety belt into a single, cohesive object. Visualize the skeletal x-ray as the central frame of the object, maintaining its monochrome, translucent qualities. Integrate the safety belt by replacing the spine section of the x-ray with a safety belt, ensuring the belt's strap follows the natural curvature and alignment of the spine, while the buckle can act as the vertebrae. The entire image should maintain a minimalistic style with a limited color palette, focusing on the subtle interplay of black, white, and shades of gray to highlight the fusion of these objects into one unified design.
