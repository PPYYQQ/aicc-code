Create an image in minimalistic style focusing on the theme of addiction. The image should feature a human-like dummy sitting or standing in a neutral pose, holding a single cigarette delicately between its fingers. The background should be plain and uncluttered, using a soft, muted color palette. The dummy should be simple and featureless, emphasizing the universal nature of addiction, while the cigarette stands out as the central element, representing the addiction itself.
