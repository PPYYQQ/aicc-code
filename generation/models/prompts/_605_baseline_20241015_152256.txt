Create a minimalistic image illustrating the concept of "Election Manipulation." The composition should feature a simple and stark design with the following elements: a ballot box prominently displayed in the foreground, with a stream of votes symbolically flowing out of it. These votes should appear to be moving towards a paper shredder, which is positioned to the side. Use a limited color palette, focusing on neutral tones and perhaps a single accent color to highlight the paper shredder, symbolizing the destruction or alteration of votes. The overall tone should be subtle yet thought-provoking, capturing the essence of election manipulation.
