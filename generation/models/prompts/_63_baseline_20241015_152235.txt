Create an image in a minimalistic style titled "Smoking Addiction." The composition should feature cigarettes arranged in a stark and simple manner. Below the cigarettes, incorporate a textured representation of tobacco soil, symbolizing the root or foundation of the addiction. To the side or slightly overlapping the soil, place a cross tombstone, subtly suggesting the grave consequences of smoking. Use a muted color palette with shades of gray and brown to maintain the minimalistic aesthetic and emphasize the somber theme.
