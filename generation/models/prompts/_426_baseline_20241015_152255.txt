Create a minimalistic image that conveys the theme of "Health Risks" by depicting a sharp, cleanly designed knife positioned near an ice lolly. The background should be simple and uncluttered, perhaps using a solid pastel color to enhance the minimalist style. The knife should have a sleek, modern appearance, while the ice lolly is vividly colored to draw attention. Arrange the objects such that the knife's edge is subtly pointed towards the ice lolly, suggesting a juxtaposition of danger and innocence. Keep the composition balanced and focused on these two elements to emphasize the message.
