Create a minimalistic image that merges an eye and a camera into a single object. Start with the shape of an eye as the base, focusing on its almond shape. Replace the iris with a camera lens, ensuring the lens fits naturally within the eye's circular pupil area. Use the camera lens's color and texture to add detail, but keep it simple and clean to maintain a minimalistic aesthetic. Incorporate subtle camera-like elements along the edges of the eye, such as a hint of a shutter or aperture, but ensure they blend seamlessly. The final object should appear as an abstract fusion of both the eye and the camera, unified and singular.
