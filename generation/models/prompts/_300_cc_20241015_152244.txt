Create an image in a minimalistic style centered around the theme of "Environmental Destruction." The image should feature a single mashup object combining elements of a hermit crab and a can. Begin by visualizing the shell of the hermit crab as a metal can, incorporating the cylindrical shape and metallic texture, while the crab's legs and claws protrude naturally from this can-shell. Maintain a muted color palette with metallic grays and hints of the crab's natural colors, such as browns and reds, to emphasize the blend of nature and pollution. The background should remain simple and unobtrusive, focusing attention on the singular hybrid object.
