Create an image in a minimalistic style illustrating the theme of "Pollution Impact". The composition should include: an anatomical heart and a trash bag. The anatomical heart should be positioned centrally, symbolizing life and health, while the trash bag looms ominously in the background, slightly faded to represent the threat of pollution. Use a limited color palette with muted tones to emphasize the theme's seriousness. Ensure the overall design is simple and uncluttered, with strong visual contrast between the heart and the trash bag.
