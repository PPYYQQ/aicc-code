Create an image of a single minimalistic object that combines an energy drink can and a battery. Start with the basic shape of a cylindrical energy drink can, keeping its metallic and glossy finish. Replace the top of the can with the positive terminal of a battery, complete with a flat disc and a little "+" sign to indicate the positive side. Incorporate the battery's color scheme—such as black and silver or black and red—into the design of the can, merging the two seamlessly. Ensure the overall look is sleek and clean, highlighting the theme of "Recharge" through this harmonious blend of the two objects. The background should be plain and unobtrusive to maintain the minimalist style.
