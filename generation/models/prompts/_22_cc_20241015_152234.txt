Create a minimalistic mashup image by combining a pepper and a fire extinguisher into a single object. Start with the basic shape of a fire extinguisher, but replace the handle and nozzle with the curved stem of a pepper. Use the vibrant red and green colors of a pepper for the body of the extinguisher, with subtle shading to convey depth. Ensure the extinguisher's pressure gauge and trigger remain visible, but incorporate a pepper's texture and stem to blend the two items seamlessly into one cohesive design. The background should be simple and muted to emphasize the uniqueness of this singular object.
