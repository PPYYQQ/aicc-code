Create a minimalistic image centered around the theme of "Observation." The image should present a single object that is a creative mashup of a CCTV camera and wood. Consider the cylindrical shape of a CCTV camera and blend it with the texture and grain patterns of wood. Replace the outer casing of the CCTV camera with a wooden texture, maintaining the lens and electronic elements as subtly integrated components to convey the concept of observation seamlessly. The final result is a singular, cohesive object representing both surveillance and natural elements, with a neutral, simple background to highlight the object.
