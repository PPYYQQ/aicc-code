Create an image in a minimalistic style on the theme of "Learning." The composition should include a piece of cake on a white plate accompanied by a fork, symbolizing the idea of learning being enjoyable and rewarding. Next to the plate, place a small stack of books, representing knowledge and education. On top of the piece of cake, place a single cherry, signifying the sweetness of discovery. Use a simple color palette with soft pastel shades, focusing on clean lines and a balanced layout to convey a sense of calm and clarity.
