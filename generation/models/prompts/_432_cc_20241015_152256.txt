Create an image of a minimalistic style that combines an "index value/closing price" chart with the USA flag into a single object. The image should integrate the upward and downward lines of the chart as the stripes of the flag. Use the red and white color scheme of the flag for the chart lines, replacing the traditional horizontal flag stripes with the dynamic vertical movements of the chart. Position the blue field with white stars in the top left corner, ensuring it seamlessly blends into the chart design. The entire image should appear as one cohesive object, maintaining simplicity and clarity.
