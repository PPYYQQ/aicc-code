Create an image featuring a minimalistic design with a Marlboro Reds cigarette case. The case should be open, and instead of cigarettes, it should be filled with French fries. The image should clearly convey the concept of substitution, using only the Marlboro Reds case and the French fries, to suggest the theme of health risks associated with smoking and unhealthy eating. Ensure the design remains clean and simple, focusing on the contrast between the original content and the new one.
