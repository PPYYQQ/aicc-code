Create an image in a minimalistic style, featuring a serene scene with a small, simplistic boat floating on a calm, flat surface. Next to the boat, depict a stack of neatly arranged books. Use a limited color palette with soothing, muted tones to emphasize tranquility and simplicity. The overall composition should evoke a sense of peaceful readiness, as if the boat and books are gently awaiting a journey of learning and exploration. Focus on clean lines and uncluttered space to embody the concept of "Knowledge Preparation."
