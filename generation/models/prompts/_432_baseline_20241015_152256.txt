Create a minimalistic image that explores the theme of Capitalism. The image should feature a stylized "index value/closing price" chart that subtly suggests the fluctuation of market trends. Integrate the USA flag into the design, perhaps as the background or by blending it with the chart lines, using simple and clean lines. The overall color scheme should be restrained, focusing on red, white, and blue tones to emphasize the connection to the USA. The composition should be balanced and uncluttered, conveying the complexity of capitalism through simplicity.
