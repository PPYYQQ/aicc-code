Create a minimalistic image featuring a unique mashup object that symbolizes climate change. Begin with the silhouette of a penguin, focusing on its iconic shape. Replace the penguin's torso with a melting ice lolly to symbolize the melting ice caps. Ensure the ice lolly's melting effect flows seamlessly into the shape of the penguin's body, blending the icy colors into the penguin's black and white palette. The overall image should be simple and clean, with a plain background to emphasize the combined object.
