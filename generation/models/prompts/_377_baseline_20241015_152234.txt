Create an image in a minimalistic style that conveys the theme of "Powerlessness." Imagine a solitary pencil lying horizontally on a plain background, its sharp tip broken off. From the broken tip, a gentle wisp of smoke rises, curling upwards into the empty space above, suggesting fragility and the ephemeral nature of power. The color palette should consist of muted tones, utilizing soft grays and whites to enhance the sense of vulnerability and stillness in the composition.
