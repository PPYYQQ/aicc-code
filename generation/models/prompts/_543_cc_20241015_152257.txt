Create an image in a minimalistic style that conveys the theme of environmental degradation. The image should consist of a single object that transforms a globe into a trash bag, emphasizing their visual similarities. The object should maintain the spherical shape and size of the globe but feature the texture and color of a black trash bag. The continents on the globe are subtly hinted at through slight wrinkles and folds, resembling the appearance of a trash bag. Ensure the image has a simple, monochromatic background to keep the focus on the object and enhance the overall theme.
