Create a minimalistic image that symbolically represents the theme of pollution. Use a simple color palette to convey the message. The image should feature a single fish swimming in a vast, empty space, highlighting its solitude. Nearby, place a plastic bottle, partially submerged, to symbolize pollution. The fish and the plastic bottle should be the only elements in the composition, with clean lines and plenty of negative space to emphasize the minimalistic style.
