Create an image in a minimalistic style that conveys the theme of "Urgency." The image should feature a simple, clean illustration of a timer and the Earth. Position the timer prominently in the foreground with a distinctive countdown display. Behind or next to the timer, incorporate the Earth, depicted in a simplified globe form. Use a limited color palette, focusing on contrasting colors like black, white, and a few shades of blue and green for the Earth. The overall composition should emphasize the fleeting nature of time in relation to global matters, capturing a sense of urgency through its simplicity and starkness.
