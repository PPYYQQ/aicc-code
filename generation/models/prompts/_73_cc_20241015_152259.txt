Create a minimalistic image of a white plate and a fork placed on a simple background, with a single cherry on the plate. Replace the traditional piece of cake with a stack of books, arranged neatly on the plate next to the cherry. The books should be small enough to fit comfortably on the plate, symbolize learning, and complement the minimalistic aesthetic.
