Create a minimalistic image that focuses on the theme of "Observation." The composition should feature a CCTV camera and a wooden element as the primary objects. The design should be simple and clean, with a limited color palette to emphasize the minimalistic style. Position the CCTV camera prominently, perhaps mounted on a sleek wooden post or integrated with a wooden texture, suggesting a blend of technology and nature. Use negative space effectively to highlight the objects and convey a sense of calm and introspection. Aim for a balanced, harmonious arrangement that captures the essence of observation through simplicity.
