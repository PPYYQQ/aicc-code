Create an image in a minimalistic style focusing on the theme of "Perception". Feature a single, stylized eye and a simplified camera. Position the eye at the center, using clean lines and a monochromatic palette to emphasize clarity and focus. Place the camera below the eye, using basic geometric shapes to convey its form. Ensure the overall composition is balanced, with ample negative space to highlight the simplicity and essence of perception through both natural and technological lenses.
