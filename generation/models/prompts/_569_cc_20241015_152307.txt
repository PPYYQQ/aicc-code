Create an image in a minimalistic style featuring a single object that is a mashup of a dummy and a cigarette. The object should take on the elongated cylindrical shape and size of a cigarette, but its tip should be replaced with the pacifier part of a dummy. Use the typical white and tan colors of a cigarette for the base and incorporate soft pastel colors like baby blue or pink for the pacifier tip to highlight the contrast and the theme of addiction. The background should be simple and uncluttered, using a neutral color like light gray to emphasize the object.
