Create a minimalistic image that conveys the topic of smoking addiction. Include the following elements: 1. A pile of ash shaped like a human figure, symbolizing the diminishing effect of smoking on a person's life. 2. Scattered ash surrounding the human-shaped ash, emphasizing the pervasive nature of smoking addiction. 3. A single cigarette nearby, partially burnt, its smoke subtly blending into the human-shaped ash, illustrating the connection between the habit and its impact on the individual. The composition should be simple, using a monochromatic color palette with shades of gray and black to highlight the somber theme. The background should be plain to focus attention on the central elements.
