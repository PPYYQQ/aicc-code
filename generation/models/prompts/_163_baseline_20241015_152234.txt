Create a minimalistic image centered around the theme of health risks. Depict a simple composition featuring a box of Marlboro Reds cigarettes on one side and a small pile of French fries on the other. Use a plain, light-colored background to emphasize the contrast between the objects. Ensure that both the cigarette pack and the French fries are stylized with clean lines and muted colors, reflecting a minimalist aesthetic. The overall layout should be balanced and uncluttered, highlighting the health implications of these items through visually striking yet simplistic imagery.
