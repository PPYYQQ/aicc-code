Create a minimalistic image depicting environmental destruction. Visualize a hermit crab using a discarded can as its shell, symbolizing the impact of pollution on wildlife. The scene should be simple and clean, with a stark contrast between the natural form of the hermit crab and the cold, metallic texture of the can. Use a limited color palette to emphasize the theme, focusing on muted earth tones for the crab and a contrasting metallic hue for the can. The background should be minimalist, evoking a sense of emptiness and loss, to highlight the central image.
