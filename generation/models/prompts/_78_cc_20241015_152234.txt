Create a minimalistic image depicting a vast, tranquil sea under an open sky. Floating just beneath the surface, where you would expect to see the graceful silhouette of a jellyfish, place a translucent, gently shifting plastic bag. The scene should evoke a sense of quiet beauty disrupted by the presence of pollution, emphasizing the intrusion of human waste into natural environments. The image is to express the theme of pollution succinctly and powerfully.
