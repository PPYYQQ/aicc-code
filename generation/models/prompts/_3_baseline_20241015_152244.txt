Create an image with a minimalistic style exploring the theme of "Symmetry in Nature." The composition should feature an orange and lungs, emphasizing their symmetrical elements. Position the orange centrally, highlighting its radial symmetry, and display the lungs on either side, showcasing their bilateral symmetry. Use a clean, simple background to enhance the minimalistic aesthetic, with a color palette focusing on natural and earthy tones such as soft oranges and muted greens. Let the symmetry of these objects be the focal point of the design.
