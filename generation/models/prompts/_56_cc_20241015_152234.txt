Create an image that visually represents a minimalistic style focusing on the theme of health risks. The composition should depict a single object with the appearance of drink cans with straws, but designed to closely resemble a bundle of dynamites with fuses. The drink cans should be cylindrical and arranged in a cluster, mimicking the shape and configuration of dynamite sticks. The straws should extend from the tops of the cans, simulating the appearance of fuses ready to be lit. The image should have a clean, simple background to emphasize the object, using a limited color palette for contrast and impact. The goal is to evoke a sense of danger or risk associated with some consumables, through this creative visual metaphor.
