Create a minimalistic image featuring an old man's face with a dollar note in place of any other object, such as a mask, illustrating the theme of economic inequality. The dollar note should be positioned creatively to signify its impact, perhaps covering part of the face or incorporated as a face covering, without any remnants of a mask, to highlight the concept of monetary influence and disparity. Ensure the image is simplistic, focusing solely on the old man's face and the dollar note for a profound and clear expression of the theme.
